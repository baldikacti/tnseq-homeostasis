**NOTE:  tnseq-homeostasis analysis requires python and R .**

Welcome! This is the distribution for the tnseq-homeostasis  analysis developed by the [Flaherty Lab](https://people.math.umass.edu/~flaherty/) at The University of Massachusetts Amherst.

tnseq-homeostasis  are collection of scripts for statistical analysis of Tn-Seq data.
It provides different functionalities like  estimating the change in transposon insertions attributable to gene-environment changes without transformations (rnbtn) , Constructing Conditionally Essential Networks(hdp-seq) and identifying Proximal Stress-induced Conditionally Essential Genes.


## Features
tnseq-cen offers a variety of features including:

-   Identify Conditionally Essential Genes under multiple backhrounds, conditions and stress levels using regularized negative binomial regression .

-   Constructing Conditionally Essential Networks by hdp-seq models

-   Identifying Proximal Stress-induced Conditionally Essential Genes by the knock-off approach

-   R Shiny based web app for browsing Caulobacter crescentus conditionally essential networks. Available on (https://)
